If you are also using a windows pc, you may want to install git bash to be able to run git commands. 

Other tech tools/ resources used:
1. **PhP** - a server scripting language which we'll use to collect form data, generate dynamic page content, or send and receive cookies ( although these last two functions will not air with version 1 of the web app.)

2. **MySQL** -an open-source relational database management system where we will store data from our web app.

3. **JQuery** - a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library which we'll use to execute functions efficiently on our app. We'll be reseting and re-populating indutry and sector dropdowns on our app with different values using this library.

4. **Bootstrap 5** - a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.  We'll be using this framework along with our own custom styling files to add styling to our mobile app.
